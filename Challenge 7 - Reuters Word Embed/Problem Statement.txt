Challenge 7 (NLP with Keras-TF2)
 
Implement the following on the built in reuters dataset in keras
You can use Google Colab for the actual coding and submit the link in this yammer thread.....
Please submit it by July 3rd.
1. Tokenization 
2. Padding
3. Wordindex creation and reverse word index
4. Embedding layer for word embeddings
